 * \details This driver is implemented as a disk device (see \ref DISK).
 *
 *
 * Required Peripheral Hardware:
 * - 1 SPI Bus (MODE0)
 * - 1 GPIO Pin (for chip select)
 * - 2 Optional GPIO Pins for hold and write protect
 *
 * Example:
 * \code
 * #include <hwdl/sst25vf.h>
 * #include <hwpl.h>
 *
 * sst25vf_state_t sst25vf_state MCU_SYS_MEM;
 * const sst25vf_cfg_t sst25vf_cfg = SST25VF_DEVICE_CFG(-1, 0, -1, 0, 0, 17, 4*1024*1024); //4MB part
 *
 * const device_t devices[DEVICES_TOTAL+1] = {
 * 	...
 * 	SST25VF_DEVICE("disk0", 2, 0, 0, 16, 25000000, &sst25vf_cfg, &sst25vf_state, 0666, USER_ROOT, GROUP_ROOT),
 * 	... //other devices
 * }
 * \endcode
