 * \details This is the interface for accessing monochrome LCDs.  The driver
 * allows an application to load the video memory pointer as well as the
 * width and height of the device.
 *
 * When an application accesses the LCD, it must issue a HOLD before modifying the
 * memory and a RELEASE when modification is complete.
 *
 * \code
 * int fd;
 * mlcd_attr_t attr;
 *
 * fd = open("/dev/lcd0", O_RDWR);
 * ioctl(fd, I_MCLD_GETATTR, &attr);
 * ioctl(fd, I_MLCD_HOLD, &attr);
 *  //attr.mem can be directly modified
 * ioctl(fd, I_MLCD_RELEASE, &attr);
 *  //the display will refresh based on the value of attr.freq (usually in the tens of hertz range)
